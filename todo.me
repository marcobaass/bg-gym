[x] Boardrender point 1 is top right not bottom right
[x] Offset of the top row
[x] Stack when more than 5 on pointg
[x] show checkers on bar
[x] show dice
[x] show checkers off board ( boardframe new size checken - versatz checker)
[x] show doubling cube value
[x] show score
[x] show pips
[x] Let points hover and click, but only top checker of stacks // pointIndex?!?!
[x] highlight all checkers on one point
[x] show destination point (green dot)
[X] behaviour of hover and click and next position
[x] destination from bar
[x] bear off indicator
[ ] whole move logic
    [x] remove checker from array and gray out
    [x] move checker
    [x] store moves
    [X] bear off checker
    [x] enter bar checker
    [x] hit checker
[x] correct parser - transform annotation string in array with best moves
    now: [[-2, 20][8, 2]] or [[9, 4]]
[ ] check vs. top 5 moves ui.moves array vs. bestmoves array
[ ] when parsing check for forced move
[ ] when cube action move

Step 2: Create a Comparison Function
Write a function that checks if two move arrays are equivalent. Remember:
Move order might not matter (player can use dice in any sequence)
Sort both arrays before comparing, or use a set-based approach

Step 3: Find User's Move in Best Moves
Loop through bestMoves and use your comparison function to find which one matches the user's move. Store:
The rank (1 = best, 2 = second best, etc.)
The equity of the user's move
The equity loss vs the #1 move

Step 4: Create State for the Result Modal
Add state to track:
Whether the modal is open/closed
The comparison result (user's rank, equity loss, all 5 best moves, etc.)

Step 5: Build the Result Modal Component
Create a modal/popup component that displays:
All 5 (or however many) best moves with their equity
Highlight which one the user played (or show "not in top moves" if they blundered)
Show the equity loss

Step 6: Trigger the Modal on Submit
In handleSubmitMove:
Run the comparison
Set the result state
Open the modal

Step 7: Add a "Next Position" Flow
After viewing results, let the user:
Close the modal
Optionally auto-advance to the next position
Bonus Considerations
Format move notation for display (e.g., "13/7 8/5" instead of raw arrays)
Color coding (green for optimal, yellow for minor error, red for blunder)
Handle edge case: user's move not found in bestMoves at all
